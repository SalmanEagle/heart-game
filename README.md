Theoretically, Heart is the organ of meta learning. "Heart Game" will exercise meta learning skills - by relying on a little known mathematics rule that can condense an infinitizing series of digits into 9 digits. It is the fundamental management principle of the unvierse, in my opinion.

The beauty of our Visual Memory Tablet [VMT] is that you are recalling representations of words based on a plot (x, y coordinates).

Conventionally, we only exercise vertical (and not horizontal) thinking. Horizontal Thinking, also known as Intuition, is headquartered in the Heart IMHO and based on the following Mathematics rule - I call **Recurrence**:

**If you add the digits of ANY number, no matter how large; they resolve to the digits 1 to 9.**

**For example:- the number 583. If you add the digits: 5 + 8 + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16 â‡’ 1 + 6 = 7.**

Indeed, the purpose of logical (vertical) thought is to differentiate between two "words" that have the same horizontal code. Vertical Thinking is based on considerations of one's Passion, Health and Budget; according to my "universal Nash Equilibrium Strategy" - based on Nobel Prize winning Professor John Nash's definition of Rationalism as using a singular strategy in life to solve EVERY problem.

It is my opinion that - even if it takes you 10 years to master Meta Learning, it does not matter; because once you have mastered this Recurrence based Infinity language ~ all knowledge is, theoretically, at your feet.
